print("Hello World")

My name is Matt, I'm from the United States and I'm relatively new to programming.
I have a bachelors in behavior analysis and I love computer science.

I am intermediately good at using Python but that's about it.
I hope to learn a lot, help contribute to some open-source code, and collaborate with the communtiy.
In the future I want to become a frontend developer and after that I want to work as a software developer or backend development.
